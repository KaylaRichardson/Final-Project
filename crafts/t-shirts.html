					    <td><p>Turning a t-shirt into a racerback tanktop:</p>
					      <p>MATERIALS:<br />
					      - Old t-shirt (I used my old college tshirt! We were Home of the Fighting Poets. Hahahahaha. How threatening :P)<br />
					      - Pair of scissors<br />
					      TIME: 15 min<br />
					      DIRECTIONS:<br />
					      1. Cut away the crew neck the sleeves and the bottom. For the sleeves, you will want to start at the shoulder (you decide how thick you want the strap to be) and cut straight into the chest area. Then curve. If you curve the whole way, it’s gonna look weird on you. If you have no idea what I am talking about, no worries, just follow the tutorial, you can always snip away later. Tr to follow my pictures.<br />
					      2. Clean up the edges. Decide how low you want the neckline to be.<br />
					      3. Turn the shirt to the back and make a narrower racerback.  Then cut a deep V.<br />
					      4. Take the bottom edge of the shirt that you cut off and cut the seams off so that you’re just left with fabric.<br />
					      5. Stretch it like a maniac. This is fun.<br />
					      6. You’re left with a really cool noodle thing. It’s really long too!<br />
					      7. About 2″ above the bottom of the V tie a know with one edge of the noodle.<br />
					      8. Wind it round ‘n round, then double knot it at the other end too. Cut off loose ends.<br />
					      9. To make this a hi-low top, lay your shirt sideways and flat. Then starting at about 4-5″ from the front center of the shirt start diagonally cutting down til you reach the back. You’ll want to cut straight for a bit at the front center then start creating the diagonal or else you’re gonna get a weird arrow shape with you open up.<br />
					      DONE! Start pulling at the fabric to make rough edges go curly and to make your tank longer.</p>

					    <td><p>Turning a t-shirt into a tube top:</p>
					      <p>1.  You will need a very large tshirt.  Cut off the sleeves, and then cut a straight line right below the neckline. The sleeves will become the top of the dress, and the large chunk will become the body of the dress.</p>
					      <p>2.  Take the two sleeves you cut off, and cut the side seam of the sleeve open on each of them, and lay them flat.  This will give you a nice long strip of fabric. (This will be the top of the dress, so test the rectangle pieces against your bust for coverage. As in-measure from your bra band to however high you want to cover your bust.)   Cut out 2 identical rectangle pieces. Don't cut off the finished sleeve hem- later you can use this as the top hem on the dress.</p>
					      <p>3.  Match up the top (previous sleeve) portions with the matching body (large chunk) portions.</p>
					      <p>4.  Sew (right sides together) the top pieces to each body piece.  Then sew up the side seams entirely.</p>
					      <p>5.  Sew elastic for the waist/under bust.  Sew it it straight onto the dress, stretching the elastic as you sew. (If you hate working with elastic, you could also belt the dress here while wearing it instead.)</p>
				        <p>6.  Trim access and turn dress right side out.  My shirt was stretchy enough not to need top hem elastic, but if you need it, just feed it through the top hem.</p></td>
